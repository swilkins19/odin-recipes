        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp</li>
            <li>Shallots</li>
            <li>Arborio rice</li>
            <li>White wine</li>
            <li>Vegetable stock</li>
            <li>Frozen peas</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Defrost <em>shrimp</em>, pat dry, and add salt and pepper to both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pan on high heat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil, and quickly fry <em>shrimp</em>. Try to flip shrimp only once.</li>
            <li>When <em>shrimp</em> are cooked, place on a tray, or uncrowded on a plate so that they do not continue to cook</li>
            <li>Very finely chop <em>shallots</em>.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, heat 1L of <em>vegetable stock</em>. Stock should not be hot enough to simmer.</li>
            <li>Turn on to medium-low heat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil, and sweat <em>shallots</em> in pan.</li>
            <li>When <em>shallots</em> are translucent, but before they begin to brown, add <em>arborio rice</em> and lightly toast rice kernels. Toast for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Rice should not turn black, which would mean it's been burnt.</li>
            <li>Add approximately 1 cup of <em>white wine</em>, enough to barely cover all rice. Stir gently, but continuously. At minimum, stir well every 1 to 2 minutes throughout the remainder of this recipe</li>
            <li>When wine nearly completely evaporates, add a second cup of <em>white wine</em></li>
            <li>When wine nearly evaporates, add approximately 1 cup of <em>vegetable stock</em> from pot, into rice pan.</li>
            <li>This process of waiting for liquid to nearly evaporate, then refilling with <em>vegetable stock</em> will continue until the risotto reaches the right consistency, which is completely up to you! It will likely be 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the heat used. I like my risotto on the edge past al dente, where a portion of the rice will have a bit of hardness to them, while the rest are soft. this provides contrast in the textures.</li>
            <li>By now, the <em>shrimp</em> should have cooled enough to handle. Chop <em>shrimp</em> into large, bite size pieces.</li>
            <li>When the rice reaches the perfect texture for you, add the <em>shrimp</em>, about a half cup of grated <em>parmesan cheese</em>, add 1-2 tablespoons of <em>butter</em>, then put a lid on the pan and let it sit for about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Plate nice and high into a shallow and wide bowl. Lightly shake the bowl so that the risotto lies flat. Here you can add some garnish like a chip of parmesan standing in the center of the bowl</li>
        </ol>
