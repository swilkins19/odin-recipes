# odin-recipes

This project is a recipe website meant to practice a few basics of HTML.
We will create HTML boiler plate code, 
create pages in a separate folder in the document directory, 
create ordered and unordered lists, 
and add images.
We will also practice Git commit best practices as we develop our code.
